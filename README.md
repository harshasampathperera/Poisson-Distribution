The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, provided these events occur with a known constant mean rate and are independent of the time since the last event.
Key Characteristics
Discrete Distribution: It deals with discrete events (e.g., number of phone calls received in an hour).
Parameter (λ): The distribution is defined by a single parameter, λ (lambda), which is the average number of events in the interval.
Probability Mass Function: The probability of observing 
k
k events is given by the formula:
